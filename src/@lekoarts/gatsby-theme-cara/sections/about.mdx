Hey there, I am Kritika Sharma from Himachal Pradesh. I am a microcontroller enthusiast, and I've worked on automations with ESP32, and OpenCV platforms. I hold proficient hands on experience with "Electric Motors", "Electric Switchgears & Applications", and I've working experience with ECP (Electric Control Panels).
Apart from being a grand holder of Hardware Academia, I have a good grasp of the software side of this paradigm. Including crediting in several "DevConf" and derivative conferences, I am well versed with several of DevOps tools comprising Git, Docker, Kubernetes, and other cloud tools as well.
I prefer attributing to arts and reading to employ my free time.
